     -                             screen is rotated 





What is the best way to about this project? 
1. Taking advantage of the sample project and the notes would defintaly help. I believe is will be easier to understand and cement knowledge as there are still areas where I did not apply myself, I just blindly followed whatever the instructor was saying. 
2. After that, you can even go over the notes in Sublime - will and act as a refresher. 
3. Make sure this is all done with forced attentiona dn speed - you need to move on to making the APP asap.
