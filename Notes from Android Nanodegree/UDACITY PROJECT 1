					UDACITY PROJECT 1 


Note: Acitvities have back stacks where fragments are recorded. 

A fragment is not required to be part of an activity layout. However when it is, this can in two ways: 

You can insert a fragment into your activity layout by declaring the fragment in the activity's layout file, as a <fragment> element, or from your application code by adding it to an existing ViewGroup. 


You will probably have to create 2 different layouts for one fragment. Say one contains the Linear Layout listview. The other will contain the textView  - each eleement of the lsit view. When you initially create the text view, it occupies the whole screen -  but you need to change the total height of this at the top to occupy just one row.


WHEN YOU CREATE A CLASS, IT NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE MANIFEST.
