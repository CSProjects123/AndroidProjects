						Notes on Project 0 

When you add a button, the xml code gets added automatically in fragment_main. 


Note: in order to sync with github, first create a git version with "gut init" and then add the commit with a comment ( git commit -m "aFirst commit")

Copy the address of teh repository in github and:
git remote add origin remote repository URL
# Sets the new remote
git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL

Then push:
git push -u origin master



You should create custom styles when code is being repeated.
